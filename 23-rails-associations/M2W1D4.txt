19:39:18	 From Wilson Ng : ;0
19:39:22	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : üåü `rails g resource` -> give you model, migration, controller, views, and routes
19:39:28	 From Lida : Yeeessss!
19:41:16	 From Jade Decordova : Shouldn‚Äôt word def be 1 -1
19:41:46	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : @jade what do you mean?
19:42:58	 From Lida : yay!!
19:44:12	 From Franklin Bado : Show the command again plz
19:45:54	 From Franklin Bado : Thanks
19:45:58	 From Franklin Bado : Migrate now
19:46:17	 From Eric Kim : Whenever you add in foreign keys to your model, rather than saying `word_id:integer`, you can write `word:belongs_to`
19:47:20	 From Eric Kim : If you use the `word:belongs_to`, your model will get generated with the ActiveRecord macros
19:48:47	 From Anna Kim : does resources come with all 7 actions?
19:48:52	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : ^ yup
19:49:22	 From Patrick Pierre : Oh ok so we should focus on writing out all the routes ourselves
19:49:26	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : So if you only want to use two, you should use the only keyword
19:49:29	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : yes
19:49:44	 From Jade Decordova : Hybriding CRUD
19:49:48	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : @Patrick yup, so you get used to writing routes in the case your need a custom one

19:58:10	 From Franklin Bado : Thanks
19:58:10	 From Anna Kim : can you do rails g resource student favorite:has_many ?
19:58:13	 From Eric Kim : @emmanuel - no
19:58:59	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : recap @Manny‚Äôs question: fat model, skinny controller. Any db manipulation should be in the model file
19:59:13	 From Eric Kim : ^^^ - Also, the `self` inside the StudentsController class is different from the `self` inside the Student
19:59:26	 From Emmanuel Jose : Thank you Sylwia!
20:00:05	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : Recap @Anna‚Äôs question: there‚Äôs only belongs_to, no has_many :<

20:02:38	 From Jade Decordova : Active record is magic

20:11:14	 From Alex E (she/her) : why @byebug?
20:11:26	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : it was a typo
20:11:47	 From Alex E (she/her) : Oh there was an @ when there shouldn‚Äôt have been.  I see now
20:11:50	 From Eric Kim : THERE HAS TO BE AN EASIER WAY!
20:12:03	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : SHOW US THE BETTER WAY
20:12:37	 From Anna Kim : select tag!
20:12:52	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : Anna ++
20:17:06	 From Patrick Pierre : Could we also just write out the html and embed the ruby on the value attribute or do we have to do it this way?
20:17:31	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : you can write out html code, but this is meant to make your life easier
20:17:44	 From Eric Kim : ^

20:23:40	 From Jacinta (Jacie) Calixte : its how we wrote it

20:23:50	 From ChenYun Zhang : ^^^^^^^^
20:23:50	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : LOL
20:23:53	 From Jacinta (Jacie) Calixte : LOL
20:24:05	 From Franklin Bado : Science‚Ä¶ Human science
20:24:08	 From Anna Kim : downcase?
20:24:16	 From Jade Decordova : capitalize
20:24:52	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : I would stay way from naming your method the same as a method that already exists in ruby
20:25:00	 From Eric Kim : Titleize -> Capitalizes the first letter of each words and then some
20:25:01	 From Anna Kim : ^
20:25:08	 From Alex E (she/her) : what are ‚Äústrong‚Äù params?
20:25:20	 From Jade Decordova : OH Gracias

20:27:58	 From Anna Kim : do you have to .save it?
20:28:01	 From Ekaterina Zarudnaya : Question regarding titleize..  Capitalize and then..? Didn‚Äôt understand the 2nd part.
20:28:11	 From Jacinta (Jacie) Calixte : it give it an authorization key with strong params right?
20:28:24	 From Eric Kim : It does a little more than capitalize, but it‚Äôs not relevant right now
20:29:00	 From Ekaterina Zarudnaya : Thank you
20:30:23	 From Wilson Ng : oooh so I can‚Äôt do :admin => true üòî
20:30:31	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : Recap @Alex‚Äôs question: 1. It safeguards your forms from getting hacked, prevents certain attributes on the form to be changed. 2. We can specific which attributes are allowed to get accepted or not.
20:30:43	 From Nunny (she/her) : ^^^
20:30:58	 From Eric Kim : Pulled from the docs:
20:30:59	 From Eric Kim : This means that you'll have to make a conscious decision about which attributes to permit for mass update
20:31:11	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : ++
20:33:01	 From Franklin Bado : Student index?
20:35:32	 From Jade Decordova : Self.student.id?
20:36:08	 From Eric Kim : Self in this case is an instance of a controller
20:36:39	 From Jade Decordova : Thx
20:37:26	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : params.require(:MODEL_NAME).permit(:ATTRIBUTE1, :ATTRIBUTE2, :ATTRIBUTE3, ‚Ä¶)    - Eric
20:37:53	 From Eric Kim : They‚Äôre just a bunch of symbols being passed in as arguments
20:42:05	 From Franklin Bado : Squid angry !
20:42:38	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : <%# %> how to comment in erb files

20:46:00	 From Kalkidan Taye : Where is the iterator
20:46:05	 From ChenYun Zhang : angry squid

20:46:38	 From Franklin Bado : Don‚Äôt you have to iterate one more time?
20:46:39	 From Samantha Balgobin : .word.content? Instead of .word
