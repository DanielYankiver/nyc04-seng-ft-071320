10:04:00	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : @christy -> ;-;
10:04:06	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : The tacos are amazing here though
10:04:16	 From Christy Tropila : lol :)
10:04:47	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : and it was my husband‚Äôs grandma‚Äôs bd yesterday so I did get to eat quality Dominican food üåù
10:05:17	 From Waverley Leung : ^ oooooo üòã
10:06:50	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : The best of both worlds ‚ú®
10:07:01	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : class component -> state + lifecycle methods
10:07:21	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : Function components can‚Äôt but hooks are the trick that makes it all possible ‚ú®
10:08:10	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : (But almost all the legacy code in companies is not written with hooks so don‚Äôt panic yet)
10:11:49	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : Also, nothing will happen if you just change App.js into a functional component (but Eric wants to show you creating the app from scratch)
10:22:47	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : The son file. You could have on the frontend will be only a getter, not setter
10:23:00	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : hson*
10:23:04	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : json*
10:23:49	 From Kalkidan Taye : ^^Thank you Sylwia.
10:45:10	 From Patrick Pierre : Why can‚Äôt we use handleInputChange ?
10:46:12	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : useState REPLACES the objects entirely, does not merge them like setState does
10:46:53	 From Patrick Pierre : Is this the only downside when it comes to using hooks?
10:47:09	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : It‚Äôs not a downside! It‚Äôs just different design.
10:47:37	 From Patrick Pierre : Oh ok thanks Sylwia
10:47:51	 From ChenYun Zhang : how about use a spread operator.
10:48:25	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : with spread op you may end up with an error about doubling same keys
10:48:39	 From ChenYun Zhang : ok, thank you
10:49:04	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : e.g. if you already have in the state a key for name and then the user came back to re-fill out the name field, you will try to add the name key again
10:52:57	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : (There‚Äôs also a library for handling forms with hooks: react-hook-form )
10:57:03	 From Patrick Pierre : That chunk of code that we cut with hooks is great for load time right?
11:01:01	 From Kalkidan Taye : I trust you and your teachings Eric‚Ä¶anything you say goes. Even the chicken examples.
11:01:24	 From Waverley Leung : ^^
11:02:58	 From Patrick Pierre : How does javascript know the difference between them?
11:16:23	 From Waverley Leung : do you need to build out everything with hooks? Or if we want, can we try out just one?
11:16:29	 From Christy Tropila : Thank you Eric
11:18:28	 From Waverley Leung : thank you! üòÅ
11:18:34	 From Kalkidan Taye : Compliments: Thank you Eric.
