14:01:58	 From David Felix : Everything with enough ketchup tastes good
14:05:02	 From Christy Tropila : ^^^
14:12:21	 From Jacinta (Jacie) Calixte : so on click is an event listener?? no need to write it out anymore??
14:12:39	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : Yup!
14:12:56	 From Jacinta (Jacie) Calixte : wow ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯
14:13:30	 From Samir Triande : React documentation+++
14:13:33	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : 1. Find the JSX that we want an event to happen on 
2. Pass in an attribute theâ€™s specifically named the event that we want ex: `onClick`
14:13:46	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : thatâ€™s*
14:14:26	 From Eric Kim : https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html
14:16:17	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : No one likes doing that. Inline event handlers are just really frowned upon (unless itâ€™s a functional component thatâ€™s just like 10 lines)
14:19:41	 From Christy Tropila : can you explain again why handleOrderClick() won't work
14:21:18	 From Christy Tropila : thx
14:22:07	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : @christyâ€™s q: When youâ€™re working inside of the render function, you donâ€™t have access to the outer scope so you have to use the `this` to refer to something in the outer scope
14:22:32	 From Franklin Bado : You can have a module that holds all event listener and then import the file here in Store.js right?
14:24:18	 From Waverley Leung : can you repeat the difference between evt.target and evt.currentTarget?
14:24:23	 From Anna Kim : ^^^
14:25:49	 From Waverley Leung : thank you!
14:30:58	 From Anna Kim : i was just about to ask, arrow func replaces .bind?
14:33:23	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : Come back at 2:38~
14:42:41	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : Sylwia ++
14:44:14	 From Emmanuel Jose : This is initial state?
14:46:21	 From Anna Kim : curly
14:46:31	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : Anna ++
14:48:56	 From ChenYun Zhang : with these, you donâ€™t need to write the constructor function?
14:49:13	 From ChenYun Zhang : ok
14:49:26	 From Franklin Bado : Do we need both, like at the same time? Wht if you only want to have state?
14:55:03	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : DO NOT MUTATE STATE
15:00:16	 From Emmanuel Jose : setState is how children communicate back to parent?
15:00:43	 From Emmanuel Jose : Ok, thank you!
15:03:57	 From ChenYun Zhang : setState is used to change props?
15:05:24	 From Anna Kim : can you write this.state +1 inside handleOrderClick?
15:08:37	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : Remember to use console.log!!
15:08:44	 From Anna Kim : thank you
15:11:18	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : React dev tools : https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi/related?hl=en
15:15:21	 From Anna Kim : but this doesnâ€™t get saved in our backend right?
15:16:10	 From Anna Kim : i thought setState was going to be the answer to replace fetch... in my dreamsâ€¦
15:23:30	 From Patrick Pierre : Donâ€™t they both use a value from our previous state?
15:24:50	 From Wilson Ng : so that functional setState example you have there is the same as line 25-26? functionally speaking
15:25:11	 From Anna Kim : oldState is undefined no?
15:25:26	 From Anna Kim : ah. ok
15:26:07	 From Patrick Pierre : What makes it better?
15:26:59	 From Anna Kim : should we use setState for every state key attributes?
15:32:21	 From Anna Kim : can a parent component can have state?
15:32:27	 From Eric Kim : https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-state.html
15:33:02	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : @Anna -> yes!
15:33:14	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : And you can pass the state value down to a child as props
15:33:37	 From Eric Kim : https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html#step-3-identify-the-minimal-but-complete-representation-of-ui-state
15:34:06	 From Anna Kim : @sylwia ty!
