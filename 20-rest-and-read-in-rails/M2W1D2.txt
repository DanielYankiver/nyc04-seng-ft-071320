19:28:31	 From Franklin Bado : Hello‚Ä¶
19:28:42	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : Hi üëã
19:29:11	 From Franklin Bado : We are quiet, this is weird ..
19:33:56	 From Samantha Balgobin : That‚Äôs awesome, thank you!
19:34:09	 From Emmanuel Jose : We love it!
19:34:13	 From Kalkidan Taye : ^^
19:34:26	 From Ekaterina Zarudnaya : I love that idea!
19:38:54	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : when you run `rails new` `bundle` is run for you so you‚Äôre able to see all the gems that are installed
19:42:58	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : `rails g` ‚Äî give information about rails generators
19:43:36	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : ex: `rails g migration` <‚Äî creates a migration
19:44:05	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : üåü MODELS ARE SINGULAR, EVERYTHING ELSE IS PLURAL üåü
19:44:10	 From Ekaterina Zarudnaya : Sylwia I don‚Äôt see the bottom of the terminal
19:44:13	 From Dong Xia : why rails generate not in rails -T?
19:44:22	 From Ekaterina Zarudnaya : Thank you!
19:44:29	 From Ekaterina Zarudnaya : Much better
19:45:47	 From Eric Kim : @Dong - I think it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs using a different Gem rather than being a rake task, it‚Äôs using the Spring gem to generate the migrations
19:46:49	 From Franklin Bado : Model is singular
19:47:03	 From Christy Tropila : amazing
19:47:10	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : `rails d <action> <name of action>` ‚Äî deletes
19:47:43	 From Samantha Balgobin : Is this Hogwarts
19:48:05	 From Emmanuel Jose : ^^^ Dark Arts magic
19:48:41	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : `Rails g migration` ‚Äî only creates the migration file
19:49:05	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : `Rails g model` ‚Äî creates the migration file + model file and makes sure they‚Äôre connected
19:51:21	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : if you don‚Äôt pick a datatype for model attributes, it defaults to string
19:51:56	 From Wilson Ng : didn‚Äôt migrate yet
19:51:58	 From Christy Tropila : rails db:migrate
19:52:03	 From Franklin Bado : Rake db:migrate
19:52:06	 From Jade Decordova : ^^^^
19:53:33	 From Eric Kim : ty ty
19:54:02	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : You can create instances in two ways: seeds file + in the rails console
19:55:39	 From Christy Tropila : we need a controller
19:56:01	 From Franklin Bado : How do you get that console at the bottom of the page?
19:56:19	 From Franklin Bado : I don‚Äôt have it ..
19:56:21	 From Wilson Ng : certain versions?
19:56:25	 From stevenwilliams : What if it‚Äôs not?
19:56:48	 From Franklin Bado : This is only a nice to know for us‚Ä¶
19:56:57	 From stevenwilliams : Should we update rails version?
19:57:00	 From Wilson Ng : ^rails console always works
19:57:05	 From Nunny (she/her) : ^^^
19:57:12	 From ChenYun Zhang : ^^^^^^^^^
19:57:17	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : honestly you don‚Äôt need it, I‚Äôd just use the terminal
19:57:22	 From Nunny (she/her) : ^^^^
19:57:25	 From Franklin Bado : Got it .. aim for a 404 error
19:57:26	 From ChenYun Zhang : ^^^^^^^
19:57:29	 From Wilson Ng : lmfao
19:57:30	 From Christy Tropila : ^^^^^^^^^^^^^\
19:57:41	 From Emmanuel Jose : It‚Äôs not worth the squeeze
19:57:48	 From Christy Tropila : lol
19:57:49	 From Franklin Bado : But it is..
19:57:58	 From Emmanuel Jose : Franklin don‚Äôt touch or squeez
19:58:00	 From Eric Kim : I usually just keep two terminals running - one for the server and the other for console
19:58:00	 From Wilson Ng : tequila juice
19:58:07	 From stevenwilliams : To confirm.  This function is not available for labs?  But it is available for projects?
19:58:10	 From Emmanuel Jose : LOL Wilson
19:58:15	 From Franklin Bado : You can have 3 terminals‚Ä¶ think of the possibilities
19:58:22	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : ~ commercial break~
20:01:23	 From Eric Kim : I think the gem responsible for it is called web-console
20:03:12	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : `no route matches` error means that you have to: check routes file `config/routes`
20:03:40	 From Wilson Ng : path
20:03:45	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : You have to tell the application, where to do and what to do by writing it in the routes file
20:03:53	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : go*
20:05:13	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : `uninitialized controller` error ‚Äîyou have to check if the controller exists
20:05:16	 From Nunny (she/her) : Thats cooool
20:05:20	 From Emmanuel Jose : ^^^
20:05:28	 From Patrick Pierre : ^^^
20:10:35	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : MVC: 
- design pattern: step solution to a known problem 
- Model - View - Controller 
- It solves the problem of merge conflict by providing organization and splitting the responsibility. 
- Model ‚Äî talking to the database, any database manipulation 
- View ‚Äî Whenever the client will be seeing 
- Controller ‚Äî the middle person, it receives the request and communicates it with the model and relays it to the view
20:10:50	 From Patrick Pierre : What is meant by convention over configuration?
20:11:26	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : ‚ÄúFat models, slim controller‚Äù 
- Keep the business logic that‚Äôs associated in the model class instead of the controller
20:12:47	 From Eric Kim : The idea of models being singular and tables being plural does not need to be followed - it‚Äôs just convention/easier to do so
20:13:02	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : Rails magic works because it relies heavily on convention i.e. the way you write certain things, so you have to follow the rules closely
20:14:07	 From Nunny (she/her) : You need a view ?
20:14:10	 From Emmanuel Jose : Waiter needs to come to the table.
20:15:09	 From Eric Kim : Controller created the Views
20:15:42	 From Franklin Bado : Just .erb?
20:16:15	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : Recap: you can write just `erb` or `html.erb`
20:16:58	 From Eric Kim : https://www.stuartellis.name/articles/erb/
20:17:04	 From Nunny (she/her) : Instance variable
20:17:04	 From Anna Kim : instance variable
20:17:05	 From Kalkidan Taye : Instance variable
20:17:36	 From Anna Kim : instance of /students
20:17:39	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : @students is an instance variable of the controller class
20:18:22	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : Garbage collection ‚Äî memory management, as soon as you don‚Äôt need something, ruby gets rid of it for you to free up space
20:18:26	 From Nunny (she/her) : yes
20:18:27	 From Franklin Bado : Yes
20:18:28	 From Kalkidan Taye : yes
20:18:28	 From Anna Kim : yes
20:18:29	 From ChenYun Zhang : yes
20:20:18	 From Ekaterina Zarudnaya : one
20:20:25	 From Ekaterina Zarudnaya : For 1 page
20:20:39	 From eisea904@newschool.edu : Does h1, h2, etc just determine the font?
20:20:49	 From Franklin Bado : Yes
20:20:51	 From Hortencia : Yes
20:20:56	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : you should only have one h1 tag for accessibility, and everything else should be in cascading order
20:21:06	 From Eric Kim : Yes and no
20:21:09	 From Nunny (she/her) : @Alex they are Headers so its with the sizing
20:21:21	 From Eric Kim : For screen readers, I believe that the tags do matter in importance
20:22:10	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : in the erb file, to use bye bug, you have to place it between ice cream cones <%
20:22:28	 From Franklin Bado : Loop them
20:23:00	 From Kalkidan Taye : You are missing your do? After map.
20:23:11	 From Franklin Bado : no
20:23:14	 From Jade Decordova : ^^
20:23:20	 From Franklin Bado : Angry squid
20:23:22	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : Daisy ++
20:23:22	 From Emmanuel Jose : Daisy +++
20:23:36	 From Jade Decordova : Daisy +++
20:23:52	 From Wilson Ng : ooooooh
20:23:52	 From Nunny (she/her) : Ice cream keeps it hidden
20:24:32	 From Hortencia : ^^^
20:25:01	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : <%= : angry squid shoots out ink, i.e. shows on the page 
<%: you want to hide your ice cream from other. i.e. doesn‚Äôt show on the page, only evaluates the ruby code 

‚Äî Sylwia‚Äôs blog
20:25:22	 From Nunny (she/her) : The text
20:25:25	 From Maysoon (She/Her) : link
20:25:45	 From Anna Kim : we need to add :id
20:25:45	 From Franklin Bado : You need a route
20:25:46	 From Kalkidan Taye : No route
20:26:04	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : Anna ++ Franklin++ Daisy++
20:26:44	 From Eric Kim : If my grandma sees something like that, she‚Äôs gonna get a heart attack
20:26:49	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : ^^
20:26:52	 From Eric Kim : Please don‚Äôt give my grandma a heart attack
20:27:02	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : üòÇ
20:27:12	 From Franklin Bado : She is gonna use byebug Eric‚Ä¶
20:27:26	 From Emmanuel Jose : Is the text after ‚Äúhref‚Äù a relative path?
20:27:54	 From Eric Kim : Yep, a relative path
20:28:09	 From Emmanuel Jose : Thank you!
20:28:09	 From Nunny (she/her) : The number of the student there
20:28:15	 From Samantha Balgobin : Before and after ‚Äústudent.first_name‚Äù do we only need one angry squid? It looks like there an angry squid and an ice cream cone.
20:28:16	 From eisea904@newschool.edu : ice cream cone?
20:28:25	 From Franklin Bado : Quotes for the id only
20:28:27	 From eisea904@newschool.edu : Oh squid, right? Yeah like that
20:29:59	 From Anna Kim : https://medium.com/swlh/cheatsheet-which-erb-tag-should-i-use-4b3de261f15f
20:30:05	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : ^^
20:30:08	 From Anna Kim : to see sylwia‚Äôs post on angry squid and ice cream cone!! :D
20:30:40	 From Samantha Balgobin : Oh that answered my question, thanks anna
20:31:00	 From Anna Kim : [also on the readme i think as sylwia mentioned - gotta look through those resources she added this morning]
20:31:38	 From Anna Kim : @annie we don‚Äôt need to put <% %> around HTML tags like <a href ?
20:34:04	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : Recap: have as few of the erb tag as possible, only when you‚Äôre evaluating ruby code, you should use the erb tags
20:34:25	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : index: see all instances
20:34:45	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : show: see only a specific instance
20:35:01	 From Nunny (she/her) : ^^^^^
20:35:13	 From Nunny (she/her) : Find. by
20:35:20	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : Nunny++
20:35:23	 From Kalkidan Taye : ^^
20:35:27	 From Emmanuel Jose : Nunny +++
20:39:25	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : Rails gives you access to the params and breaks it down into key-value pairs and then you can get access to the id
20:40:04	 From Wilson Ng : so with byebug - we don‚Äôt have to exit and enter again? that‚Äôs cool
20:40:14	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : nope, you can just continue!
20:40:26	 From Samantha Balgobin : ^ this is great
20:40:26	 From Wilson Ng : üÜí ty
20:40:31	 From Eric Kim : c to continue
20:41:47	 From Samantha Balgobin : So is continue just refreshing the code after you make changes?
20:42:06	 From Wilson Ng : can we do params.id instead of params[:id]?
20:42:30	 From Eric Kim : No, but you can do params[‚Äúid‚Äù]
20:42:55	 From Wilson Ng : üëç
20:43:08	 From ChenYun Zhang : squid?
20:43:10	 From Anna Kim : squidddd
20:43:25	 From Wilson Ng : the helpful squid
20:44:10	 From Anna Kim : shouldn‚Äôt we add space ‚Äú ‚Äú ?
20:44:18	 From Franklin Bado : Don‚Äôt you need two have it in two lines?
20:46:19	 From Franklin Bado : Fat and slim like Eric said
20:46:20	 From Nunny (she/her) : ‚ÄúFat models, slim controller‚Äù
20:46:23	 From ChenYun Zhang : ‚ÄúFat models, slim controller‚Äù -Annie
20:46:55	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : @sam, I think continue just exits out of the bye bug loop and goes on with the application. I don‚Äôt think it takes into consideration the code you wrote during bye bug but only the code you wrote before bye bug
20:48:04	 From Anna Kim : we don‚Äôt have to write any macros inside Model Student for all the methods to work in View students?
20:48:29	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : You do have to write the macros inside of the models to show the connections
20:48:47	 From Samantha Balgobin : Thank you annie!
20:48:59	 From Anna Kim : ^ are the macros the same as the AR ones?
20:49:04	 From Maysoon (She/Her) : bold
20:49:10	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : @Anna yup!
20:49:16	 From Anna Kim : ^ty!!
20:49:20	 From Emmanuel Jose : Maysoon +++
20:49:21	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : Maysoon ++
20:49:39	 From Kalkidan Taye : So just to confirm are the Models, views, and controllers linked so they are able to access methods in models and values as a whole?
20:49:55	 From Eric Kim : If you have an instance of a model
20:50:02	 From Eric Kim : in the controller or the views
20:50:12	 From Eric Kim : you can always call methods on it
20:50:23	 From Eric Kim : (assuming it‚Äôs inside the appropriate ERB tags
20:51:30	 From Kalkidan Taye : Ok. Thank you Eric.
20:52:43	 From Anna Kim : a href
20:52:55	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : Sylwia seemed so excited to see the syntax error haha
20:53:00	 From Anna Kim : ^^
20:54:04	 From Eric Kim : In Mod 4, your computer needs to support 2 servers running at the same time
20:54:15	 From Hortencia : Same error I have
20:54:33	 From Emmanuel Jose : Sylwia referencing herself +++
20:54:45	 From Anna Kim : @eric what does that mean?
20:55:10	 From Hortencia : Getting same error
20:55:22	 From Ekaterina Zarudnaya : 2 servers! %)
20:55:46	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : `<link_to (text to click on) (path) />` rails tag, wrap it in <%= for it to appear on the page
20:57:06	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : Oops, no angled bracket < around the link_to
20:57:32	 From Wilson Ng : so that changes the prefix when we run rails routes‚Ä¶that‚Äôs cool
20:57:44	 From Emmanuel Jose : ^^^
20:58:31	 From Franklin Bado : Aim for errors yay!
21:00:40	 From Franklin Bado : Rails got tired
21:00:42	 From Wilson Ng : the action wants to show one student
21:01:05	 From Nunny (she/her) : Bc it wants the instance that show runs
21:01:06	 From Hortencia : ^^^
21:01:24	 From Anna Kim : students_path?
21:02:22	 From Christy Tropila : student_var.id?
21:02:51	 From Hortencia : Christy ++++++++++
21:03:03	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : CHRISTY!!!!!! YES
21:04:12	 From Christy Tropila : Ruby also has our back and you can just type in student_var
21:04:20	 From Emmanuel Jose : Christy +++ Dream Team live-coding +++
21:04:24	 From Christy Tropila : lol
21:04:32	 From Anna Kim : ^ i saw that you can also just type in student
21:04:33	 From Bella Evalle : Yay! Christy +++
21:04:59	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : Recap: dynamic routes need you to pass in the associated id
21:07:47	 From Eric Kim : CONVENTION OVER CONFIGURATION
