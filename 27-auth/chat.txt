13:36:36	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : Flash is a hash the lasts for on response-request cycle
13:36:41	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : that*
13:37:53	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : Each request-response is stateless -> it behaves independently from one another, if you want a request at 10AM and you make it again at 11AM. These two request donâ€™t know about each other.
13:39:11	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : If we want to keep track of information, we can store it in cookies and lives in your browser. With each request response, the cookie will be sent along with each request and response. Back and forth
13:39:29	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : My favorite extension for reading NYT articles hehe
13:42:21	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : Cookie is an instance of the CookieJar class and it functions similarly to a hash where you can use key to store values
13:48:05	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : Cookies can be easily manipulated by using a google chrome extension. It is saved as a string datatype.
13:49:04	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : Cookies, params, flash, session <â€” all reserved words in rails
13:50:35	 From Jacinta (Jacie) Calixte : and thatâ€™s because of the auth right?
13:51:03	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : Yup, because weâ€™re using sessions now
13:51:09	 From ChenYun Zhang : are they all independent, just like params
13:51:52	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : @chenyunâ€™s question, yes â€” you can name it whatever you want
13:53:58	 From Franklin Bado : In session[:student_id] this preserve the datatype?
13:55:19	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : @Franklinâ€™s question, sessions preserves datatype, cookies makes it in a string
13:56:10	 From Wilson Ng : is sessions from the gem Bcrypt or built into rails?
13:56:11	 From ChenYun Zhang : can you use find() here? Student.find()
13:56:45	 From ChenYun Zhang : ok, thank you
13:58:00	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : @Wilson, itâ€™s built into rails
13:58:35	 From Franklin Bado : Same for other models right.. like if you go to /words
13:58:59	 From ChenYun Zhang : application applies to all models i think
13:59:09	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : Yuppp
14:01:01	 From Annie Zheng (she/her)  To  Eric Kim(privately) : 3 mins break soon
14:02:19	 From ChenYun Zhang : helper
14:02:20	 From Anna Kim : before action?
14:02:25	 From Anna Kim : get current student
14:02:59	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : application.html.erb applies to all of the routes so you need the instance variables that you put in application.html.erb to be accessible from the every action
14:09:34	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : All Controllers inherits from the ApplicationController so whatever you write in the ApplicationController will apply for the other controllers
14:10:07	 From Samantha Balgobin : What about when you go to login?
14:11:37	 From Samantha Balgobin : What if youâ€™re not logged in as anyone
14:11:45	 From Samantha Balgobin : Lol yeah thatâ€™s my question
14:15:59	 From Anna Kim : add angry squid on line 15
14:17:05	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : If you want to use a method own your application controller in another, you have to write helper_method. It allows you to call those methods in the view
14:17:29	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : In*
14:18:17	 From Franklin Bado : You can have more than one ?
14:18:54	 From Hortencia  To  Eric Kim(privately) : Just in the application controller? Before action?
14:19:52	 From Kalkidan Taye : lol
14:19:56	 From Anna Kim : lol
14:19:59	 From Samir Triande : ehehe
14:21:06	 From Anna Kim : redirect?
14:21:11	 From Franklin Bado : Send it somewhere
14:21:13	 From Jacinta (Jacie) Calixte : isnâ€™t it a button to do something
14:21:37	 From Franklin Bado : Points to a method
14:22:16	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : button_to give you a HTML form that makes a request-response
14:22:48	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : and in the process redirects you somewhere
14:24:30	 From Hortencia  To  Eric Kim(privately) : But you already have a â€œsay bye Eric button on the bottom? What is that one doing?
14:28:15	 From David Felix : How do you exclude something from the before_action
14:28:49	 From Annie Zheng (she/her)  To  Eric Kim(privately) : Letâ€™s take another 3 min break soon~
14:28:52	 From Jacinta (Jacie) Calixte : ok thanks!
14:47:37	 From Anna Kim : can we just add it?
14:55:51	 From vina : The h1 tag needs to be closed /
