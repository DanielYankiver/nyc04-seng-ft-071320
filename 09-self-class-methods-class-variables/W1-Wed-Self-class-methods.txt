18:24:31	 From Anna Kim : what is the return value of instance variables that are left blank?
18:26:03	 From Samantha Balgobin : To reiterate, class variables can be used anywhere?
18:26:24	 From Nunny (she/her) : Could you go to your head_n_shoulders method and show it again for 2 seconds?
18:29:47	 From Shema                        M. Bryan : Nice pic Isabel :) stunning.
18:30:23	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : hehehe thank you shema!
18:32:59	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : note: we can access @@all anywhere within the Dog class.
18:36:16	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : note: you can call instance methods on an instance of a class (like chaos_the_corgi), and you can call class methods on the entire class (like Dog).
18:37:13	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : therefore, when you write a class method, you want to use the syntax `def self.method_name` to call it on the class itself
18:38:32	 From Anna Kim : you added a method to a method?
18:38:40	 From Ekaterina Zarudnaya : Self is much shorter
18:38:40	 From ChenYun Zhang : one has self
18:41:34	 From Jade Decordova : amazing
18:42:17	 From Anna Kim : thank you
18:42:51	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : "self is a special variable that points to the object/class that "owns" the currently executing code."
18:45:06	 From Anna Kim : will you briefly go over monkey patching practice?
18:45:09	 From Emmanuel Jose : Why do attribute names have the same syntax as symbols/keys? Will that be a problem with hashes?
18:45:58	 From Emmanuel Jose : Thank you!
18:46:05	 From Samantha Balgobin : Great question ^
18:46:41	 From Anna Kim : instance/object
18:47:36	 From Shema                        M. Bryan : class
18:47:40	 From Maysoon : class
18:47:49	 From Maysoon : Not sure though
18:50:50	 From Anna Kim : aww
18:51:06	 From Nunny (she/her) : But now they are in the all variable?
18:51:29	 From ChenYun Zhang : @@all is an array
18:51:30	 From Anna Kim : @nunny: i think they are stored in the @@all
18:51:33	 From Nunny (she/her) : Like the Dog class is the box but now its another a variable?
18:52:28	 From Nunny (she/her) : Yes
18:55:40	 From Nunny (she/her) : ooooh
18:57:12	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd1t5khOZLtqz-uGVuRcf3EffxwyrN8GcZNQnvVVHQY9Wm3nA/viewform
18:59:09	 From ChenYun Zhang : Thank you Sylwia, yâ€™all enjoy your lunch!
