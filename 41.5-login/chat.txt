13:39:11	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : the login form only shows up when it‚Äôs appended to the page
13:42:44	 From Nunny (she/her) : Rails params
13:42:56	 From Waverley Leung : Nunny ++
13:43:32	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : submit event listener for login form -> make a POST request and pass in the user‚Äôs in put in the body of the request
13:44:42	 From ChenYun Zhang : after you logged in, if you refresh the page, are you still logged in, or you need to login again?
13:45:02	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : ^^^ great question!
13:45:19	 From Nunny (she/her) : üßê ^^
13:45:43	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : we need to figure out a way to handle the route for the login POST request
13:47:16	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : -> let‚Äôs go over to our rails backend
13:47:23	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : -> open up the routes.rb file
13:47:34	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : -> write a new route for login POST request
13:47:46	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : post ‚Äú/login‚Äù, to: ‚Äúteachers#login‚Äù
13:49:01	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : -> create a new method in the teachers controller called ‚Äúlogin
13:49:25	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : if you put a byebug in side ‚Äúdef login‚Äù you can see that params with the user‚Äôs input got passed in
13:51:38	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : inside the login method, let‚Äôs look for a Teacher instance that matches the user‚Äôs input, and save it to a variable
13:52:01	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : @found_teacher = Teacher.find_by(name: params[:key])
13:52:20	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : *** eric is only using an instance variable because he likes the colors in the code ***
13:52:34	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : @found_teacher will either return: nil or an existing Teacher instance
13:53:05	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : we‚Äôre using ‚Äúfind_by‚Äù because just ‚Äúfind‚Äù will error out if an instance is not found
13:56:52	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : write a conditional statement that‚Ä¶ either renders the json for @found_teacher IF it‚Äôs valid, OTHERWISE, it displays an error message if it‚Äôs not valid
13:58:26	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : *** logging in is just like making another a request/response cycle ***
13:59:17	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : *** serializers have nothing to do with making fetch requests ***
13:59:43	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : if you get an error, it‚Äôs most likely because of the way you wrote the fetch, rather than the serializer itself!
14:02:12	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : *** you can also create a global teacher object that changes every time someone logs in ***
14:12:22	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : woohoo!!
14:17:12	 From Franklin Bado : Button?
14:20:49	 From Franklin Bado : Do you have access to console.log the teacher too?
14:22:02	 From Anna : theres teacher id inside classroom 
14:28:24	 From Franklin Bado : classroom_id singular for the controller
14:30:13	 From Nunny (she/her) : @everyone bc serializers handle the response right?
14:42:25	 From Nunny (she/her) : Thank uuuuu
14:42:26	 From Anna : thank you
