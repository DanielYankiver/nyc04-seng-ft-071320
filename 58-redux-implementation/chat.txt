09:47:33	 From Patrick Pierre : Can you quickly go over how you get access to router props again, my internet cut out just now
09:54:52	 From Waverley Leung : do you need to pass in props (for a functional component) to have access to ownProps?
09:58:56	 From Anna Kim : yayy
09:59:17	 From Anna Kim : thank you so much
10:02:51	 From Anna Kim : MSTP?
10:07:45	 From Anna Kim : is there a way to stall the function so it doesn’t error out?
10:09:25	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : Come back at 10:15~
10:19:35	 From Anna Kim : local
10:19:37	 From Nunny (she/her) : Local since its a form?
10:23:48	 From Jade Decordova : joiner
10:23:51	 From Waverley Leung : global state for user?
10:23:59	 From Anna Kim : ^
10:24:02	 From Franklin Bado : Own props
10:24:32	 From Anna Kim : routerprops?
10:24:39	 From Jade Decordova : ownprops
10:24:43	 From ChenYun Zhang : props
10:24:53	 From Anna Kim : ChenYun+_
10:25:03	 From Nunny (she/her) : ShowFox
10:30:59	 From Wilson Ng : what’s the attributes for this joiner again?
10:32:18	 From ChenYun Zhang : Is the authorization used when we want the user to login in order to do something.
10:33:05	 From ChenYun Zhang : ok, thank you
10:35:09	 From Wilson Ng : how come you don’t have to pass in a user_id in the body?
10:35:31	 From Anna Kim : will you convert that into id in the backend?
10:37:12	 From Waverley Leung : oooo
10:38:59	 From Anna Kim : before action?
10:40:19	 From ChenYun Zhang : Anna+++
10:40:38	 From Anna Kim : so glad we have his blessing to use the code
10:41:25	 From Nunny (she/her) : Truly the gift of mod4
10:41:42	 From ChenYun Zhang : ^^
10:45:56	 From Anna Kim : could you show the create method again?
10:46:28	 From ChenYun Zhang : why you use user.pet.create() instead of Pet.create()
10:47:31	 From Anna Kim : ^^ good question
10:49:26	 From Lida : To be clear if you have joiners in the backend - that is how you go about creating that joiner.
10:50:15	 From Anna Kim : do we have pet reducer already?
11:04:16	 From Anna Kim : could you show what ownProps looks like console logged?
11:04:37	 From Anna Kim : thank you
11:06:27	 From Anna Kim : true, props is what is being passed down from the parent hierarchy, not what it is by itself
