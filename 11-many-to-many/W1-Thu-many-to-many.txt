20:48:01	 From David Felix : It is getting recorded so…
20:48:03	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : “fortnite” is a video game, but sylwia spelled it in a silly way hehe.
20:48:16	 From hortencia : ^^^
20:48:19	 From Anna Kim : ah okie. I was thinking of Fortnite i guess lol
20:48:39	 From Kalkidan Taye : @Anna best question ever…
20:48:42	 From Franklin Bado : Erick!!!
20:48:52	 From Christy Tropila : lol
20:48:54	 From Annie Zheng : LMAOOO
20:48:55	 From Anna Kim : hehe
20:48:58	 From Jade Decordova : comedy GOLD
20:49:01	 From Emmanuel Jose : 🤣
20:49:04	 From Kalkidan Taye : lolololol
20:49:05	 From hortencia : ^^^
20:49:07	 From Franklin Bado : This is the best lecture so far
20:49:20	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : sorry sylwia, i thought you spelled it like that on purpose to take a shot at eric 😆
20:49:27	 From Annie Zheng : ^^
20:50:39	 From Emmanuel Jose : It’s okay Sylwia!
20:50:44	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : any questions on many to many relationship?
20:50:48	 From Anna Kim : can we sort it by date?
20:51:36	 From Franklin Bado : If you are writing the the seed lets say for patient in the patient file, then you switch the patient arg to be self?
20:51:47	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : ^ if we want to sort it by date, we’d have to format the strings differently OR put it in Datetime format, which is a ruby data type.
20:51:56	 From Jade Decordova : sort by time
20:52:16	 From Anna Kim : @isabel thank you!
20:52:32	 From Annie Zheng : @jade, similar to sorting by date
20:52:40	 From Anna Kim : oooh Ruby has another data type called Datetime format!
20:52:46	 From Emmanuel Jose : If we don’t know all the arguments of a new instance, should default values be set in the instance variables?
20:52:47	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : ^^^^^ yup yup it’s great
20:55:38	 From Anna Kim : so adding the #specici_class name on the attr_accessor line gives the joiner access to all of its instances along with its instance methods?
20:56:17	 From Emmanuel Jose : specialty
20:56:40	 From Annie Zheng : I think Anna’s mic is broken
20:58:01	 From Anna Kim : yes
20:58:21	 From Anna Kim : but we don’t have to capitalize it
20:59:27	 From Annie Zheng : Nope, we don’t have to capitalize it to have access to the instance b/c it’s now an attribute of appointment
20:59:37	 From ChenYun Zhang : is the attribute stands for a instance
20:59:59	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : 3 minute break!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
21:00:00	 From Annie Zheng : yes, so @doctor is referring to the doctor instance
21:00:31	 From Annie Zheng : yes, so @doctor attribute** is referring to the doctor instance
21:00:44	 From Annie Zheng : Just clarifying ;)
21:01:03	 From ChenYun Zhang : another question: can we use something else, like specialty attribute to represent the instance
21:02:01	 From ChenYun Zhang : nvm, i think i mixed the concept.
21:02:27	 From Anna Kim : thank you @annie~~~
21:06:16	 From ChenYun Zhang : Thank you!!! @Annie
21:07:43	 From Annie Zheng : :)
21:10:23	 From hortencia : er
21:10:35	 From Jade Decordova : with s
21:12:58	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : accessing all of a specific doctor’s appointments: call the select method on `Appointment.all` and set the condition to equal the appointment’s doctor as `self`.
21:13:21	 From Anna Kim : Sylwia, did you add ‘self’ in front of the method appointment because of preference?
21:13:52	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : ^ self.appointments is calling on the method that we just wrote above it!
21:14:16	 From Anna Kim : @isabel (would ruby get confused if i didn’t write self?)
21:14:19	 From Annie Zheng : Yup, there’s implicit `self` in an instance method but it’s good to be explicit where you’re getting it from
21:14:31	 From Anna Kim : ^ got it
21:14:34	 From Anna Kim : thank you both
21:15:25	 From Annie Zheng : Anna ++
21:15:27	 From Jade Decordova : is “my” a good substitute to understand self relationship in the class
21:15:37	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : accessing all the patients connected to a doctor: call on the appointments method that we just wrote. map over this array and mutate the data so that it only returns the patients information.
21:16:14	 From Franklin Bado : Plural for appointment
21:16:19	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : @jade yes! you can think of it as “this current instance’s blah blah blah
21:16:52	 From Annie Zheng : Franklin ++
21:16:54	 From Annie Zheng : Jade ++
21:17:10	 From Emmanuel Jose : Pretzel colons! 🥨
21:17:19	 From Annie Zheng : Yasss!
21:17:30	 From Anna Kim : @emmanuel! thanks for that metaphor. easy to memorize~
21:17:36	 From Patrick Pierre : will that alternative syntax work with any code block in ruby?
21:18:09	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : pretzel colon is good for each or map, but wait to use it for select or find.
21:18:30	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd1t5khOZLtqz-uGVuRcf3EffxwyrN8GcZNQnvVVHQY9Wm3nA/viewform
21:19:24	 From Patrick Pierre : What website do you recommend for us to use to create our own domain models?
21:20:01	 From Annie Zheng : Awwapp.com
21:20:01	 From Anna Kim : ^ awwapp !
21:20:05	 From Annie Zheng : ^
21:21:12	 From Patrick Pierre : Oh ok I asked to see if there were any other sites that we can use for this
