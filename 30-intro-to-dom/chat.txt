00:22:47	Anna Kim:	Will each of those events (input) need their own controller?
00:22:53	Annie Zheng (she/her):	in mod2, the browser refreshes in order for the update the browser/dom (ex: likes) to increase 
In mod3, we want to update the browser/dom (ex: likes) without a page refresh
00:24:13	Annie Zheng (she/her):	@Anna’s question: for the js, each event handler will have it’s own function but no controller

01:00:40	Eric Kim:	https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp
01:01:22	Franklin Bado:	If you do querySelector(‘ul li’) then it means that ul has to exist right? Like if you have the li wrap with ol instead, then it will say null?
