10:39:43	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html ‚Äî react docs: we‚Äôll be covering everything during the `Main Concepts` this week
10:40:49	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : under*
10:41:11	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : React Docs are ones of the best written docs out there (not joking) + they are available in many languages, even those that are not very popular in the tech world (e.g. Azerbaijani)
10:41:24	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : Please please please start building asap
10:44:11	 From Anna Kim : will we be using babel while building react app?
10:44:39	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : create-react-app sets everything up for you <3
10:44:46	 From Anna Kim : yay. whew. thank you
10:47:15	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : `npm i -g create-react-app` : package that allows you to install create react app
10:47:51	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : ^ only need to do this once
10:49:04	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : `create-react-app <project name>` : create a new react app for you similar to `rails new <project app>`
10:51:10	 From Jacinta (Jacie) Calixte : list of stores
10:51:13	 From David Felix : Objects?
10:51:15	 From Dong Xia : a list of bubble tea
10:51:30	 From Emmanuel Jose : +++++
10:51:37	 From Jacinta (Jacie) Calixte : YES
10:51:40	 From Jacinta (Jacie) Calixte : Bubble teaaaa
10:51:44	 From Lida : ++++++
10:52:21	 From Alex E (she/her) : story time is spelled wrong‚Ä¶ storeytime
10:52:32	 From Anna Kim : pun intended hehe
10:52:35	 From Alex E (she/her) : oh lol
10:52:56	 From Jacinta (Jacie) Calixte : does it install like this every time?
11:14:17	 From Nunny (she/her) : Did you say both ports are at 3000?
11:14:30	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : yes^
11:14:57	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : A trick for that is opening Rails first and then opening react server
11:15:04	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : it will prompt you to change the port :)
11:15:24	 From Christy Tropila : ^^ cool!
11:16:18	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : You can also change the package.json and specify a different port there
11:16:26	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : but that feels like an overkill for labs :)
11:22:11	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : Service workers are for your app to be available offline
11:22:21	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : For e.g. push notifications
11:30:24	 From Nunny (she/her) : üî• +++
11:31:01	 From Anna Kim : is there a script tag index.js inside index.html?
11:32:34	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : @anna‚Äôs q: react is using web pack to send out all of the js files, you don‚Äôt have to make sure if your script is deferred
11:35:25	 From Patrick Pierre : What‚Äôs the difference between the DOM and ReactDOM?
11:38:12	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : here‚Äôs a nice and approachable blog post on the virtual Dom: https://dev.to/maulik/the-best-example-to-understand-virtual-dom-4lfn
11:38:34	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : Read read ^
11:39:37	 From Nunny (she/her) : amazing.
11:41:25	 From Dong Xia : what about img tag?
11:41:43	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : img tag is self-closing :)
11:41:59	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : 1. Anywhere you‚Äôre writing JSX ‚Äî you have to `import React from ‚Äúreact‚Äù`
2. You have to be very careful as to how you write your JSX tags, it will throw an error if you forget to close tags
11:42:29	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : While we are on img tags: React really cares about accessibility and will shout at you if you don‚Äôt include a proper alt attribute
11:42:39	 From Patrick Pierre : If it is self closing do you need the slash?
11:43:24	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : self closing means it‚Äôs <something/> and not <something> </something>
11:45:15	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : Pls come back at 11:50~
11:59:50	 From Patrick Pierre : So we don‚Äôt have to build out the components themselves using OOP?
12:00:15	 From ChenYun Zhang : can we use export name here?
12:00:39	 From ChenYun Zhang : ok
12:00:41	 From Anna Kim : so we only have to import ReactDOM on the file that we are rendering everything to the DOM?
12:03:03	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : ^ yes
12:03:59	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : ‚ú® React is awesome ‚Äî it‚Äôs like playing with Lego, you just connect different blocks
12:04:13	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : Think about reusability!
12:05:32	 From Christy Tropila : Is the styling that we see for that header a default style?
12:08:02	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : ^ default for the browser
12:09:17	 From Anna Kim : Daisy ++
12:10:57	 From Emmanuel Jose : Render is always a return value?
12:11:18	 From Emmanuel Jose : Ok, thanks!
12:15:37	 From Christy Tropila : would the fetch request be above the return statement?
12:17:31	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : @Christy: I love the question and how you think about it! Actually, the answer will be: yes and no.
12:18:04	 From Anna Kim : Quicklys‚Ä¶ the old days
12:18:22	 From Christy Tropila : @Sylwia thank you!
12:18:53	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : (We‚Äôll use a so-called lifecycle method, a tool given to us by React, to have the fetch work for us when we need it and when the component is ready to get the data :) )
12:19:17	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : (That‚Äôs in the class components)
12:19:25	 From Christy Tropila : Sounds convenient
12:20:06	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : (In the functional components, you will have it above the render but I think it will not be too often that you will have a fetch in functional components for the reason you will see later today and tomorrow)
12:24:19	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : ‚ú®think about props like a gift from a parent to their children: ‚Äúhere, my Store1 child, is my gift to you, a name: Quicklys‚Äù, ‚Äúhere, my Store2 child, is my gift to you,  a name: Vivis‚Äù
12:24:46	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : ‚ÄúHere, my Header child, is my gift for you: nothing, I don‚Äôt like you too much‚Äù
12:25:02	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : üíî
12:25:08	 From Emmanuel Jose : Sylwia ü§£
12:25:21	 From Kalkidan Taye : lol
12:26:19	 From Anna Kim : {} ?
12:26:23	 From Kalkidan Taye : ^^^
12:27:12	 From Kalkidan Taye : Anna++
12:28:28	 From Emmanuel Jose : Props can never be stated without ‚Äúthis,‚Äù correct?
12:29:15	 From ChenYun Zhang : if it‚Äôs in a function, you can use props without this
12:29:26	 From Kalkidan Taye : Who doesn‚Äôt love all their children lol?? Can you imagine Christmas? You get a gift, you get a gift‚Ä¶not you I don‚Äôt like you lololol
12:29:43	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : this.props -> class components
12:29:49	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : Props -> functional components
12:30:12	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : @Kalkidan -> now you will remember how to explain the props for your whole life
12:30:35	 From Emmanuel Jose : Props to you, Kalkidan +++
12:30:47	 From Christy Tropila : +++
12:31:32	 From Kalkidan Taye : Lol‚Ä¶.
