1. Run `bundle`.
2. Write migrations.
3. Run `rake db:migrate` to migrate tables to database.
4. Run `rake db:migrate:status` to confirm that all changes to database were made successfully.
5. Create `seeds.rb` file in the `db` directory.
6. Write seed data and method tests.

Note: This lab is behavior-driven development, not test-driven development. There are no learn tests, only written deliverables. So you must test all your methods to make sure they work.
