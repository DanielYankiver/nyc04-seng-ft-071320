20:06:45	 From Maysoon : Yes your right confusion lol
20:07:32	 From Dong Xia : migrate
20:07:37	 From Kalkidan Taye : db
20:07:38	 From Anna Kim : tables
20:07:40	 From ChenYun Zhang : database

20:08:21	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : jade ++
20:08:51	 From Dong Xia : single and plural
20:09:21	 From Maysoon : Is it possible to use Active Record without SQL?
20:09:21	 From Christy Tropila : a model is an object
20:09:27	 From Hortencia : id
20:09:59	 From Christy Tropila : table is stored attributes
20:10:09	 From Emmanuel Jose : Tables use raw data
20:10:10	 From Maysoon : Thank you
20:11:17	 From Christy Tropila : true
20:11:18	 From Dong Xia : yes
20:11:19	 From Wilson Ng : yes
20:11:20	 From Emmanuel Jose : yes
20:11:21	 From Nunny (she/her) : yes
20:11:23	 From Samir Triande : yes
20:11:28	 From Anna Kim : can you explain that concept one more time?
20:11:47	 From Anna Kim : the difference between model and table
20:12:30	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : okay so i googled it and i’m not 100% that you can use active record without SQL, but i found an interesting wikipedia entry about the history of active record. 🤔
20:12:30	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern
20:13:09	 From Maysoon : Thank you Isabel
20:13:34	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : maysoon ++

20:13:58	 From Ekaterina Zarudnaya : Thank you!
20:14:36	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : Gemfile stores all the extensions for the project. Running `bundle` installs all the necessary gems to make the project run.
20:15:09	 From Emmanuel Jose : Similar to Pry
20:15:12	 From Dong Xia : pry
20:15:14	 From Wilson Ng : task manager
20:15:15	 From Samantha Balgobin : Allows you to drop into pry
20:15:18	 From ChenYun Zhang : it calls pry.start
20:15:29	 From Patrick Pierre : It allows us to automate stuff with tasks
20:15:44	 From Jade Decordova : SUPERPRY
20:15:56	 From Wilson Ng : it does SQL logs
20:16:05	 From Emmanuel Jose : Jade +++
20:16:06	 From ChenYun Zhang : it allows us to initiate new instances
20:16:45	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : Rake is a gem that allows us to automate tasks.
20:16:58	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : `rake console` is one of the tasks that we can access with Rake!
20:17:02	 From Christy Tropila : if you use .new you must all use a .save method
.create combines these two steps
20:17:05	 From Nunny (she/her) : Create an instance
20:17:38	 From Anna Kim : .create actually stores the data in the table?
20:17:59	 From Christy Tropila : cread read update delete
20:18:09	 From Anna Kim : Christy ++
20:18:45	 From Anna Kim : dynamic web apps have CRUD
20:18:58	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : anna ++
20:19:13	 From Wilson Ng : find_by
20:19:16	 From Dong Xia : .find

20:19:28	 From Jade Decordova : Christy fired up 🥳🥳🥳
20:19:31	 From Nunny (she/her) : Search by attributes
20:20:23	 From Anna Kim : destroy
20:20:24	 From Wilson Ng : destroy
20:20:24	 From Nunny (she/her) : .destroy
20:20:25	 From Dong Xia : destroy
20:20:34	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : 🔥 🔥 🔥
20:22:16	 From Nunny (she/her) : Rake db status?
20:22:19	 From Dong Xia : db migrate status
20:22:22	 From Christy Tropila : db migrate:status
20:24:13	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : Creating instances only in pry is not very sustainable. So we’re going to create a separate file just to store the seed data. This file will be called `seeds.rb` in the `db` folder.
20:25:06	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : Since the seed file is a ruby file, we can write ruby code in it.
20:25:59	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : When you run `rake db:seed`, there isn’t a response in the terminal, so you can add a puts statement at the end to make sure that your seed file was run.
20:26:12	 From Anna Kim : did sylwia write task :seed in the rakefile?
20:26:27	 From Anna Kim : ah ok thank you
20:26:42	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : recap: nope, task seed is give to us from active record
20:26:43	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : ^ that task is given to us from active record
20:26:47	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : yup yup
20:26:47	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : LOL
20:26:49	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : heh
20:26:50	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : sorry!!
20:27:42	 From Anna Kim : @isabel @annie so I don’t have to ever declare that task :seed in AR? learn.co mentioned     desc 'seed the database with some dummy data'
  task :seed do
    require_relative './db/seeds.rb'
  end
20:27:54	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : Before creating seed data, check the attributes for your class in the schema file.
20:27:55	 From Anna Kim : if it’s already built it, that’s great
20:28:08	 From Anna Kim : oh..
20:28:58	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : `rake db:seed` is always given! and as long as you create your seed data file in `db` with the `seeds.rb` file name, it should run.
20:29:25	 From Anna Kim : ^^^ thank you so much
20:29:28	 From Dong Xia : cool
20:29:51	 From ChenYun Zhang : that’s cool
20:32:55	 From ChenYun Zhang : happy new year

20:39:25	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : You can find the plural version of any noun by calling `.pluralize` on a string in pry!
20:39:45	 From Patrick Pierre : How does the plant parenthood model relate to the person and plant models in terms of has many and belongs to?
20:40:18	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : Patrick ++
20:41:50	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : Person has_many Plant through PlantParenthood

Plant has_many Person through PlantParenthood

20:45:53	 From Nunny (she/her) : 😯
20:46:24	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : When you run `rake db:create_migration NAME=` you want to write the name of the table in lowercase with underscores separating the words.
20:46:26	 From Kalkidan Taye : table
20:46:27	 From ChenYun Zhang : TABLE
20:46:28	 From Nunny (she/her) : Create table
20:46:44	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : So… PlantParenthood, the class, becomes create_plant_parenthoods, the table
20:47:12	 From Nunny (she/her) : String? Boolean?
20:49:09	 From Nunny (she/her) : To migrate it ?
20:49:21	 From Kalkidan Taye : Create rb file
20:49:21	 From Nunny (she/her) : To check the status. right.
20:49:23	 From Wilson Ng : rake db:seed ?
20:50:06	 From Samir Triande : Singular ??
20:50:14	 From Emmanuel Jose : Annie +++
20:50:15	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : 1. Write the table. 2. Create the model. 3. Run the migration. 4.Seed the data.
20:50:18	 From Anna Kim : model  => singular
20:50:18	 From Kalkidan Taye : Because it is a model
20:50:19	 From Nunny (she/her) : Bc model are singular
20:50:21	 From Patrick Pierre : Model is singular
20:50:22	 From ChenYun Zhang : model singular

20:54:42	 From Samir Triande : ^^^
20:55:07	 From Isabel K. Lee (they/them) : Every time you run `rake db:seed` it’ll execute the code in your seed data. So if you keep running `rake db:seed` it’ll duplicate the instances. So make sure to write `ModelName.destroy_all` at the top of the file!!!
20:55:19	 From Franklin Bado : Run the seed again
