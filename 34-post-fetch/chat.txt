00:06:27	Annie Zheng (she/her):	LOOOL
00:07:16	Patrick Pierre:	Created an API during lunch….
00:07:30	Jade Decordova:	Pat++
00:07:31	Samir Triande:	For real ^^^
00:07:42	Patrick Pierre:	Not me I mean Eric
00:07:48	Patrick Pierre:	He said it so casually
00:07:51	Waverley Leung:	^^^^
00:07:51	Annie Zheng (she/her):	sounds like eric
00:07:56	Jade Decordova:	Oh lol
00:08:04	Samir Triande:	Too casual with it
00:10:23	Annie Zheng (she/her):	information is sent between the back and from end through render json: fox
00:10:30	Jade Decordova:	That’s actually really cool
00:10:37	Emmanuel Jose:	^^^^^
00:13:51	Jade Decordova:	Nice convention
00:14:57	Nunny (she/her):	^^
00:15:03	Annie Zheng (she/her):	stable elements are those that are hard-corded into the index.HTML
00:16:31	Anna Kim:	what is the datatype of singleFoxObj?
00:17:35	Annie Zheng (she/her):	Anna’s q: singleFoxObj is a POJO ( plain old js object)
00:22:55	Annie Zheng (she/her):	** whenever you’re adding an unable element to the page, have a helper function do that job **
00:23:05	Annie Zheng (she/her):	unstable*
00:25:01	Annie Zheng (she/her):	29
00:25:01	Christy Tropila:	4
00:25:04	Ekaterina Zarudnaya:	7
00:28:58	Annie Zheng (she/her):	***whenever you add an event listener on a stable element, make sure you’re not doing it inside of another event listener*** b/c it will only get called when the outer event is executed, on a stable element, the eventlistener should be on the global level
00:31:41	Annie Zheng (she/her):	A form doesn’t have a value, and input + select does, so you can’t pull out the value of a form
00:32:51	Annie Zheng (she/her):	event.target.f_name <— f_name is the name of an input and will pull out the corresponding input
00:33:17	Annie Zheng (she/her):	doraaaa the explorer
00:35:25	Jade Decordova:	Learn Js feels like wielding Excalibur
00:35:35	Patrick Pierre:	^^^
00:35:47	Emmanuel Jose:	^^^ a heavy-ass Excalibur


00:41:22	Waverley Leung:	woohoo
00:42:52	Annie Zheng (she/her):	FETCH — request through the frontend
00:43:01	Annie Zheng (she/her):	REST — request through the backend
00:43:46	Annie Zheng (she/her):	Restclient*
00:46:38	Annie Zheng (she/her):	Outside of a get request, you’ll need add a second arg to the fetch. It will be a obj with key value pairs of method — HTTP request type, headers — object, and body
00:47:08	Annie Zheng (she/her):	🌟 headers (plural) not header
00:49:34	Christy Tropila:	Stringify sounds like a Harry Potter spell
00:49:45	Emmanuel Jose:	^^^
00:49:47	Jacinta (Jacie) Calixte:	^^lol
00:49:48	Christy Tropila:	lol

00:55:34	Emmanuel Jose:	I forget yesterday, lol
00:55:37	Wilson Ng:	my best friend, byebug
00:55:50	Christy Tropila:	Same Emmanuel lol
00:56:08	Waverley Leung:	@Manny I was just thinking about having takeout for dinner Friday but realized it’s only Wednesday
00:56:26	Emmanuel Jose:	It’s Wednesday? lol
00:56:40	Christy Tropila:	^^^
00:57:18	Jade Decordova:	Too restricting?
00:58:48	Wilson Ng:	everything makes sense now
00:59:04	ChenYun Zhang:	^^^^^^^^^^^^
01:02:35	Emmanuel Jose:	Do we use a schema with a Rails API?
01:02:54	Annie Zheng (she/her):	What we entered into our body enters our backend as params and saved to the db
01:03:05	Annie Zheng (she/her):	@manny’s q: yup
01:04:05	ChenYun Zhang:	depends on if the  params is permitted
01:05:25	Anna Kim:	^^^
01:05:33	Annie Zheng (she/her):	params are independent from our models, the frontend doesn’t care about what is entered into the body for the backend as params
01:08:29	Annie Zheng (she/her):	chenyun++
01:11:14	Wilson Ng:	thank you
01:15:02	Anna Kim:	the arrow function has the implicit return right?
01:15:13	Annie Zheng (she/her):	arrow function w/o the {}
01:15:29	Anna Kim:	@annie thank you
01:16:01	Annie Zheng (she/her):	“swiper, no swiping!”

01:23:10	Franklin Bado:	Fox.find(img…./24)
01:26:02	Annie Zheng (she/her):	closure -> each event listener has information about itself
01:27:16	Christy Tropila:	why are we adding this event inside the turnFoxObjToLi function and not creating its own function
01:27:43	Patrick Pierre:	Can yo explain what you said about closures again and how it is relevant to what you just did
01:27:49	Patrick Pierre:	you*
01:27:55	Christy Tropila:	ohh okay unstable I get it
01:31:18	Patrick Pierre:	When you use the fetch request to get access to an API’s data can you store the result of the promise or can you only store the promise object itself?
01:35:34	Emmanuel Jose:	We don’t hate you Eric.
01:35:54	ChenYun Zhang:	no, i don’t hate, you failed, lol
01:36:01	Emmanuel Jose:	LOL
01:36:01	Nunny (she/her):	^^^^
01:36:08	Waverley Leung:	I appreciate that you care so much to warn us!
